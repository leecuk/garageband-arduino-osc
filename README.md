Garageband / Logic control using OSC on Arduino

Uploaded as a proof of concept for using Arduino for controlling Logic / Garageband.
Proof of concept includes DHCP, OSC service publication and service discovery via Bonjour.

Mostly based on code from https://github.com/TrippyLighting/EthernetBonjour

Implemented basic latching, but missing initial value read.
